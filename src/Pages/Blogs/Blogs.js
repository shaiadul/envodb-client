            <h4>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h4>
            <article className='article'><span>Answer:</span> 
             JWT, or JSON Web Token. is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. Now that you understand JSON as a data text format, you may be wondering What are tokens? To put it simply, a token is a string of data that represents something else, such as an identity. In the case of authentication, a non-JWT based token is a string of characters that allow the receiver to validate the sender’s identity.Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.

             JavaScript is a simple programming language that runs in any browser JavaScript Engine.This engine name is V8. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language that holds many excesses.. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.

            <article className='article'><span>Answer:</span> 
             SQL ~ use structured query language and have a predefined schema. -~ are vertically scalable are table based -~are better for multi-row transactions.

            NoSQL ~ NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. -~ while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. -~ NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

            <h4>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb</h4>
            <article className='article'><span>Answer:</span> 
             Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language. There are other similar tools for other languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, etc... If your application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would typically use some form of database. There are dozens of popular databases. MongoDB is one such database.
